		<h3>What are the rules?</h3>
		<p>
		The readings are sequential: we choose a book to read in 15 days - if necessary, we divide it
		into more than a fortnight. At the end of each fortnight we meet to comment on the book, the routine, 
		the origin of time and the universe and those things üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Oh, on this meets, we will also decide the next book in the sequence.
		</p>
		<h3>Why are you doing it?</h3>
		<p>
		Mar√≠lia and I love to read. Reading together has been a great experience, in addition to making you persist
		in reading, it offers someone to comment on. We strongly recommend it! ü§ó
